# KoikatsuENG
English translation for Koikatsu. This is a solo project and I translate as I advance through the game. Some strings may be missing. I haven't figured out a way to translate the buttons yet, so only the text is translated. English and Japanese aren't my native languages so there may be grammar or translation errors.

## Requirements
Latest version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/bbepis/BepInEx/releases)
Play as 柏木 壮亮 (base boy). Some strings include the protagonist's name and won't work if your name is different than the one I used in my playthrough. BepInEx currently doesn't support string detection with any name for now so it's pretty limited.

## How to install
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/FriendlySky/KoikatsuENG/releases), merge the BepInEx folder with your installation's.

## Problems or questions
Send me a message or make an issue if you have suggestions or if you spot a translation error.
