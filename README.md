# KoikatsuENG
English translation for Koikatsu. This is a solo project and I translate as I advance through the game. Some strings may be missing. I haven't figured out a way to translate the buttons yet, so only the text is translated. English and Japanese aren't my native languages so there may be grammar or translation errors.

## Requirements
Latest version of [BepInEx](https://github.com/bbepis/BepInEx/releases)
Play as 柏木 壮亮 (base boy). Some strings include the protagonist's name and won't work if your name is different than the one I used in my playthrough. BepInEx currently doesn't support string detection with any name for now so it's pretty limited.
Likewise, some strings when talking to normal students include their names. If you interact with non-base/custom characters that have different names, strings that I translated wouldn't appear because the names won't match. It's best if you play with unmodified, base characters for now.

## How to install
Download the latest [release](https://github.com/FriendlySky/KoikatsuENG/releases), merge the BepInEx folder with your installation's.

## Problems or questions
Send me a message or make an issue if you have suggestions or if you spot a translation error.
